Welcome to Allie App!

This app is designed to help kitchen staff share allergy information on the dishes that they serve at their restaurant.

anyone can sign up with their restaurant, but only admin staff can make changes to the dishes and staff members.
once logged in you will only be able to see dishes from your restaurant and dishes that are active.
